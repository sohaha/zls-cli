### Version 1.7.0 (2017-04-19)

- Changed: The [no-confusing-arrow] is no longer a special rule, but simply
  turned off, since recent Prettier versions make it redundant.
- Improved: The CLI helper tool now has a more helpful message for special
  rules, and exits with a different status code if only special rules were
  found. The exit codes are now documented as well.

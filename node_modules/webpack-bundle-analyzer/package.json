  "readme": "# Webpack Bundle Analyzer\nWebpack plugin and CLI utility that represents bundle content as convenient interactive zoomable treemap\n\n[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Downloads][downloads-image]][npm-url]\n\n## What is this for?\nJust take a look at this demo:\n\n![webpack bundle analyzer zoomable treemap](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/302213/20628702/93f72404-b338-11e6-92d4-9a365550a701.gif)\n\nThis module will help you:\n\n1. Realize what's *really* inside your bundle\n2. Find out what modules make up the most of it's size\n3. Find modules that got there by mistake\n4. Optimize it!\n\nAnd the best thing is it supports minified bundles! It parses them to get real size of bundled modules.\nAnd it also shows their gzipped sizes!\n\n## Installation and usage\nThere are two ways to use this module:\n\n### As plugin\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer\n```\n\nIn `webpack.config.js`:\n```js\nvar BundleAnalyzerPlugin = require('webpack-bundle-analyzer').BundleAnalyzerPlugin;\n\n// ...\nplugins: [new BundleAnalyzerPlugin()]\n// ...\n```\n\n`BundleAnalyzerPlugin` constructor can take an optional configuration object that defaults to this:\n\n```js\nnew BundleAnalyzerPlugin({\n  // Can be `server`, `static` or `disabled`.\n  // In `server` mode analyzer will start HTTP server to show bundle report.\n  // In `static` mode single HTML file with bundle report will be generated.\n  // In `disabled` mode you can use this plugin to just generate Webpack Stats JSON file by setting `generateStatsFile` to `true`.\n  analyzerMode: 'server',\n  // Host that will be used in `server` mode to start HTTP server.\n  analyzerHost: '127.0.0.1',\n  // Port that will be used in `server` mode to start HTTP server.\n  analyzerPort: 8888,\n  // Path to bundle report file that will be generated in `static` mode.\n  // Relative to bundles output directory.\n  reportFilename: 'report.html',\n  // Module sizes to show in report by default.\n  // Should be one of `stat`, `parsed` or `gzip`.\n  // See \"Definitions\" section for more information.\n  defaultSizes: 'parsed',\n  // Automatically open report in default browser\n  openAnalyzer: true,\n  // If `true`, Webpack Stats JSON file will be generated in bundles output directory\n  generateStatsFile: false,\n  // Name of Webpack Stats JSON file that will be generated if `generateStatsFile` is `true`.\n  // Relative to bundles output directory.\n  statsFilename: 'stats.json',\n  // Options for `stats.toJson()` method.\n  // For example you can exclude sources of your modules from stats file with `source: false` option.\n  // See more options here: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/webpack-1/lib/Stats.js#L21\n  statsOptions: null,\n  // Log level. Can be 'info', 'warn', 'error' or 'silent'.\n  logLevel: 'info'\n})\n```\n\n### As CLI utility\nYou can also analyze already existing bundles if you have Webpack Stats JSON file.\n\nYou can generate it using `BundleAnalyzerPlugin` with `generateStatsFile` option set to `true` or with this simple\ncommand:\n\n```\nwebpack --profile --json > stats.json\n```\n\nIf you're on Windows and using PowerShell, you can generate the stats file with this command to [avoid BOM issues](https://github.com/th0r/webpack-bundle-analyzer/issues/47):\n\n```\nwebpack --profile --json | Out-file 'stats.json' -Encoding OEM\n```\n\n`webpack-bundle-analyzer --help` will show you all usage information.\n\n## Definitions\n\nwebpack-bundle-analyzer reports three values:\n\n### Stat size\n\nThis is the \"input\" size of your files, before any transformations like\nminification.\n\nIt is called \"stat size\" because it's obtained from Webpack's\n[stats object](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/stats/).\n\n### Parsed size\n\nThis is the \"output\" size of your files. If you're using a Webpack plugin such\nas Uglify, then this value will reflect the minified size of your code.\n\n### Gzip size\n\nThis is the size of running the file(s) through gzip compression. Note that the\nvalue listed for the entire bundle is correct, but it will be slightly off if\nyou look at the gzip value for individual files.\n\nThis is because of the way gzip works: the more files that are gzipped together,\nthe more opportunities there are for things to be compressed. Accordingly, the\ngzip value reported for each individual file will be slightly _larger_ than the\nactual contribution that the file makes to the overall gzipped bundle.\n\n## Contributing\n\nCheck out [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on contributing :tada:\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n\n[downloads-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/webpack-bundle-analyzer.svg\n[npm-url]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack-bundle-analyzer.svg\n",
